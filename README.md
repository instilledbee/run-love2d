Brackets extension to launch LÖVE projects from the editor. Tested to work with Windows/Linux.

## Installing
Install from the Brackets Extension Manager.

## Usage
Hotkey defaults to "Ctrl+Shift+L". LÖVE will run using the current project folder. Make sure a `main.lua` file exists in your project's root folder.

## Troubleshooting
Windows: Ensure you have added the full path to your LÖVE installation to your system's PATH environment variable. 

## Contributing
Please feel free to file issues and submit pull requests as needed. If you will be able to test the extension in Mac OS X that would be awesome as well!
